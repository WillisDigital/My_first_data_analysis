## R Markdown

This my report on Gun murders in USA with summary and a plot
```{r}
library(dslabs)
library(tidyverse)
murders <- read.csv("data/murders.csv")
murders <- murders %>% mutate (region = factor(region), rate = total / population * 10^5)
save(murders, file = "rda/murders.rda")
summary(murders)
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
  
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
load("rda/murders.rda")

bar_plot  <- murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb,rate)) + 
  geom_bar(width = 0.5 , stat = "identity", color = "black") + 
  coord_flip()
plot(bar_plot)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
